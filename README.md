This GitHub is part of the submission requirements for the CSCI 5832 Natural Language Processing final project. It's code includes the completion requirements for the SemEval26 Task 10. The code was based on the Task 10 Starter Pack provided by SemEval, which was verbally approved by Dr. Jim Martin.
