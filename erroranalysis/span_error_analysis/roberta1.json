No. That’s not having “fun” on a break. This episode delves into the mysterious patents being filed, removed, and suddenly re-appearing at CERN in addition to the highly-advanced ‘holographic’ dimensions where ‘non-cooperatives’ and ‘non-complaints’ are kept.  Funny how that’s the most detailed CERN will get when discussing such a matter....",

Burroughs \n In 1989, the American author William S. Burroughs (1914–1997) wrote to Whitley Strieber, a writer previously best known for his successful horror fiction, such as The Wolfen and The Hunger, about his alleged experiences of alien contact and abduction. \n In his first supposedly non-fiction book, Communion (1987), and its sequel Transformation (1988), Strieber asserts that he was abducted from his cabin in upstate New York on the evening of 26 December 1985 by non-human beings.",

The truth in this articles is always at the bottom because they know peoples’ attention spans are only so long. They also have a new thing where they don’t lie they just don’t tell you. I have not heard a whisper of this on msm radio or tv. That’s very guilty of a coverup right away.",

The nearly 15,000 funds offered by Chinese money managers returned 30 percent on average in 2020, with the best-performers surging 10-fold, which dwarfs the average 12 percent gain for hedge funds globally, according to data from Simuwang.com, a Chinese financial-data provider, the Bloomberg reported.

Republicans are relying on electoral systems that amplify and exaggerate their representation as well as suppression of voters who won't favor their agenda.  \n This is one Republican's tweet at this point, but as Klein recognizes, it's representative of a general disdain in the Republican Party for the democratic and constitutional order.

The previous week, which reflected the period before the worst of the coronavirus hit, was 282,000, which was higher than expected at the time. \n Consensus estimates from economists surveyed by Dow Jones showed an expectation for 1.5 million new claims, though individual forecasts on Wall Street had been anticipating a much higher number. The surge comes amid a crippling slowdown brought on by the coronavirus crisis. \n Here's a good visualization of how drastic this number is .",

Raising the specter of nuclear war provides ammunition for isolationist forces in Western politics to press for the abandonment of Ukraine. Because of the economic imbalance between Russia and the West, Russia's hopes for victory in Ukraine are based on a strategy of engineering Western disengagement from the conflict.

This documentary is all about sparking curiosity and offering new perspectives on a topic that has fascinated us for ages. \n While the content is meant to be thought-provoking, it's important to note that this is a fun project, not a scientific investigation. I've woven a tale of deception and misdirection, challenging conventional beliefs and offering a fresh look at the phenomenon. \n I hope you enjoy this journey into the unknown as much as I enjoyed creating it. Feel free to share your thoughts and insights—it's all about fostering discussion and exploring the mysteries together!",

As an example, the F117-A Stealth Fighter arrived at Area 51 in 1977 for test flights, and was not made public until 1990, 13 years later. \n The secrecy at Area 51 is like no other security anywhere in the world. Although many of us would like to know what actually goes on at the base, we must remember that revealing what transpires there could, and probably would be detrimental to our National Security, since “you can’t tell your friends something, without your enemies finding out.”",

I found the following passage an interesting idea: \n In an earlier paper, I have described CTs as the epistemic equivalent of a ‘black hole’ into which unwary truth-seekers are drawn, never to escape again (Boudry, 2020). Once you adopt the central premise of a CT, you can explain away any missing evidence or counterevidence you encounter. Indeed, researchers have observed that attempts to attack CTs often backfire. For instance, CTs about 9/11 being an inside job were hardly put to rest with the publication of 600-page Report by the 9/11 Commission, or after an extensive rebuttal of every conspiracist claim by the magazine  Popular Mechanics  in 2005 (Dunbar, Reagan, & Meigs, 2011). For the believers, all of this merely demonstrated to what lengths the conspirators and their accomplices were prepared to go to shore up their lies.",

But critics of Hooke and this “physicalist” notion of reality are sceptical that man-made instruments will ever allow us to see the fundamental constituents of reality. “Nature is infinite and vast, and will inevitably, no matter how far ‘down’ we go, hide something from us,” writes Peter West.",

In this piece, the New Yorker expounds on the experiences of one victim, who felt trapped and lived with their abuser well into adulthood. Apparently this incident was only recently noticed and investigated by the German government.",

        "text": "The Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has awarded a $26.3 million contract to Lockheed Martin to complete the third and final stage of the Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) project.  SHiELD is intended “to combine an agile, small, high-power laser system on a tactical aircraft to demonstrate an advanced self-defence capability to defend against [air-to-air and surface-to-air] missile threats and enhance survivability”. The AFRL intends to test the laser on a tactical fighter testbed platform by 2021 – the fighter type has not been disclosed. \n I thought that I would share this as I was previously unaware of this program or that it is in it's third and final stage.  The final paragraph of the article brings up the interesting question of how a system like this would be powered.  I've always thought that that was/is the problem with airborne lasers?",

According to a  Delaware State Police  report, she was searching his truck because of “suspicions she had” that Hunter might use it to harm himself. \n Upon searching the truck, Hallie found Hunter’s .38 revolver. She took the firearm to the Janssen’s Market, a nearby upscale grocery store where the Biden family regularly shops at. There, she wrapped the gun in a black shopping bag and tossed it into a trash bin outside the store...",

Once you adopt the central premise of a CT, you can explain away any missing evidence or counterevidence you encounter. Indeed, researchers have observed that attempts to attack CTs often backfire. For instance, CTs about 9/11 being an inside job were hardly put to rest with the publication of 600-page Report by the 9/11 Commission, or after an extensive rebuttal of every conspiracist claim by the magazine  Popular Mechanics  in 2005 (Dunbar, Reagan, & Meigs, 2011).

There have been several meteorologists who have written  blog posts  claiming it is absolutely not true, and even the USA Today is questioning it to some extent. \n If there's an 80 mile by 80 mile swarm of ladybugs it would darken the sky and someone is going to take pictures of it. A Twitter search shows only the Doppler radar and stock photos of a bunch of lady bugs on a tree. The NWS said they were flying at 7,500 feet, but weather balloons showed the air temperature at that attitude at 55 degrees which is too cold for them to fly in.  \n What are they hiding?",

        "text": "I get these messages from other planets. I’m apparently some kind of agent from another planet but I haven’t got my orders clearly decoded yet.” – William S. Burroughs \n In 1989, the American author William S. Burroughs (1914–1997) wrote to Whitley Strieber, a writer previously best known for his successful horror fiction, such as The Wolfen and The Hunger, about his alleged experiences of alien contact and abduction. \n In his first supposedly non-fiction book, Communion (1987), and its sequel Transformation (1988), Strieber asserts that he was abducted from his cabin in upstate New York on the evening of 26 December 1985 by non-human beings.",
