Once you adopt the central premise of a CT, you can explain away any missing evidence or counterevidence you encounter. Indeed, researchers have observed that attempts to attack CTs often backfire. For instance, CTs about 9/11 being an inside job were hardly put to rest with the publication of 600-page Report by the 9/11 Commission, or after an extensive rebuttal of every conspiracist claim by the magazine  Popular Mechanics  in 2005 (Dunbar, Reagan, & Meigs, 2011).

Specifically, there are six benefits for adopting AI to analyze this feedback: It can 1) show you what you’re missing in your qualitative surveys, 2) help train your employees based on what’s actually important to customers, 3) determine root causes of problems, 4) capture customers’ responses in real time, 5) spot and prevent declines in sales, and 6) prioritize actions to improve customer experience...",

In the appeal, defense attorneys said Weinstein’s trial was tainted by a juror who had published a book about the predations of older men against younger women. “Although the defense raised legitimate questions about whether Juror No. 11 was fit to serve, the trial court failed to discharge its constitutional obligation to conduct a full inquiry to ensure that the juror was capable of rendering a fair and impartial verdict,” the defense wrote...",

The previous week, which reflected the period before the worst of the coronavirus hit, was 282,000, which was higher than expected at the time. \n Consensus estimates from economists surveyed by Dow Jones showed an expectation for 1.5 million new claims, though individual forecasts on Wall Street had been anticipating a much higher number. The surge comes amid a crippling slowdown brought on by the coronavirus crisis. \n Here's a good visualization of how drastic this number is .",

The most contentious aspect would probably be single-use residential zoning and land use for cars, especially so for those not in the planning community.  \n Proponents of zoning, particularly single-use residential zoning, often cite fears of industrial activity suddenly appearing beside their homes and the pollution and drop in value that comes with it. The article argues that this concern can be managed as not all industrial and manufacturing uses create significant negative externalities today, and that light industrial uses can be allowed near homes. Benefits include reduced commute times and allows industrial uses to continue without relocation when residential is planned in the area.",

The military has a record of developing new policies intended to curb greenhouse gases, and a massive budget of roughly $700 billion annually to carry them out.
