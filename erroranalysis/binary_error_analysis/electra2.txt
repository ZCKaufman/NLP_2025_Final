A chaotic climate would have seasons that change wildly from decade to decade (or even year to year). Some years would experience sudden flashes of extreme weather, while others would be completely quiet. Even the average Earth temperature may fluctuate wildly, swinging from cooler to hotter periods in relatively short periods of time. It would become utterly impossible to determine in what direction Earth's climate is headed.

 On Oct. 23, 2018, Hallie searched Hunter’s pickup truck, which was parked outside of her home in Wilmington, Delaware. According to a  Delaware State Police  report, she was searching his truck because of “suspicions she had” that Hunter might use it to harm himself. 
 Upon searching the truck, Hallie found Hunter’s .38 revolver. She took the firearm to the Janssen’s Market, a nearby upscale grocery store where the Biden family regularly shops at. There, she wrapped the gun in a black shopping bag and tossed it into a trash bin outside the store...

text: This is an article I wrote on the logic that drives continual Russian nuclear threats. Essentially, Russia pays no political price for nuclear saber-rattling and therefore find it a cheap way of driving up the political costs for western nations to remain engaged in Ukraine. Raising the specter of nuclear war provides ammunition for isolationist forces in Western politics to press for the abandonment of Ukraine. Because of the economic imbalance between Russia and the West, Russia's hopes for victory in Ukraine are based on a strategy of engineering Western disengagement from the conflict. Nuclear threats can therefore be seen most accurately as an element of this strategy.

 We now know that every new aircraft developed since then has been test flown there before the public became aware of its existence. As an example, the F117-A Stealth Fighter arrived at Area 51 in 1977 for test flights, and was not made public until 1990, 13 years later. 
 The secrecy at Area 51 is like no other security anywhere in the world. Although many of us would like to know what actually goes on at the base, we must remember that revealing what transpires there could, and probably would be detrimental to our National Security, since “you can’t tell your friends something, without your enemies finding out.”

Now that does not mean that Mayor de Blasio is in on some vast conspiracy, but it does indicate the intrinsic connections that are made through large bloodlines of enclosed groups that obtain and keep secret most of the knowledge that we do not have. This episode breaks down the spiritual, technological, and realistic aspect of what a suit referred to as C.A.R.P.E.T can really do.

 In an earlier paper, I have described CTs as the epistemic equivalent of a ‘black hole’ into which unwary truth-seekers are drawn, never to escape again (Boudry, 2020). Once you adopt the central premise of a CT, you can explain away any missing evidence or counterevidence you encounter. Indeed, researchers have observed that attempts to attack CTs often backfire. For instance, CTs about 9/11 being an inside job were hardly put to rest with the publication of 600-page Report by the 9/11 Commission, or after an extensive rebuttal of every conspiracist claim by the magazine  Popular Mechanics  in 2005 (Dunbar, Reagan, & Meigs, 2011). For the believers, all of this merely demonstrated to what lengths the conspirators and their accomplices were prepared to go to shore up their lies.

The White House on Friday released a preliminary outline of its fiscal 2022 spending priorities, laying out proposed spending levels across government departments and federal agencies, including defense and homeland security. President Biden's more detailed budget proposal, including tax, entitlements and debt figures, is expected in the spring...

This column explores whether worker wages are linked to worker representation on corporate boards, using ten years of data from Norway. Workers are paid more and face less earnings risk if they work in firms with worker representation on the board, but these benefits can be entirely explained by firm size and the share of unionised workers. While workers may benefit from being employed in firms with worker representation, they would not benefit from legislation mandating worker representation on corporate boards...

As a result, qualitative surveys, like Net Promoter Score, end up missing critically important feedback. Even if they provide a positive score, customers often reveal their true thoughts and feelings in the open-ended comment boxes typically provided at the end of surveys, and AI can help companies make use of this valuable data to better predict customer behavior. Specifically, there are six benefits for adopting AI to analyze this feedback: It can 1) show you what you’re missing in your qualitative surveys, 2) help train your employees based on what’s actually important to customers, 3) determine root causes of problems, 4) capture customers’ responses in real time, 5) spot and prevent declines in sales, and 6) prioritize actions to improve customer experience...

Weinstein, once a powerful figure in Hollywood, was convicted last year of rape and sexual assault and sentenced to 23 years in prison. In the appeal, defense attorneys said Weinstein’s trial was tainted by a juror who had published a book about the predations of older men against younger women. “Although the defense raised legitimate questions about whether Juror No. 11 was fit to serve, the trial court failed to discharge its constitutional obligation to conduct a full inquiry to ensure that the juror was capable of rendering a fair and impartial verdict,” the defense wrote...

 While the book and its adherent journalists made a statistical case that a unified party establishment controls the post 1970's reformed primary process to deny any chance of a Donald Trump (or Bernie Sanders) frontrunning, a huge stumble was made in part due to the observer effect.  Party elites thought that a successful primary insurgency could not happen due to the book but forgot that the book stressed the need for a unified party elite for this to happen. 
 It also gives some parting thoughts to the need for more data and academics in political reporting but stressed the impact it can have on politics and voters if there is hubris.

 The number shatters the Great Recession peak of 665,000 in March 2009 and the all-time mark of 695,000 in October 1982. The previous week, which reflected the period before the worst of the coronavirus hit, was 282,000, which was higher than expected at the time. 
 Consensus estimates from economists surveyed by Dow Jones showed an expectation for 1.5 million new claims, though individual forecasts on Wall Street had been anticipating a much higher number. The surge comes amid a crippling slowdown brought on by the coronavirus crisis. 
 Here's a good visualization of how drastic this number is .

The most contentious aspect would probably be single-use residential zoning and land use for cars, especially so for those not in the planning community.  
 Proponents of zoning, particularly single-use residential zoning, often cite fears of industrial activity suddenly appearing beside their homes and the pollution and drop in value that comes with it. The article argues that this concern can be managed as not all industrial and manufacturing uses create significant negative externalities today, and that light industrial uses can be allowed near homes. Benefits include reduced commute times and allows industrial uses to continue without relocation when residential is planned in the area.

The military has a record of developing new policies intended to curb greenhouse gases, and a massive budget of roughly $700 billion annually to carry them out. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has already signaled that he will move quickly on this issue, establishing a Climate Working Group in March to coordinate the Pentagon response to climate change and track its implementation...

 It's the opinion of our legal experts that these letters are  not  revocation letters that carry any force. We've worked with MPs on Parliament Hill, and MP Bob Zimmer has sent Bill Blair a  formal  request for clarifying information. Minister Blair is required to respond to this. Specifically, MP Zimmer is pressing clarification on whether or not these letters are formal revocations (hint: they're not). 
 The answer will detail whether this merits appeals for a s.74 hearing, or, more likely, merits nothing but ridicule.

The problem with that, is emotions are biological evolutionary traits inherited to help further survival by rewarding and discouraging different survival activities. A sentient AI shouldn't display emotions the same way, because they don't have the same biological "instincts" humans evolved to have for survival.

 Background is, Jerry Falwell jr., an American televangelist and the owner of a Christian university with extremely strict behaviour guidelines, was caught at a nightclub. The usual suspects got all pissy, and the  tu quo qe s began, and nothing happened. The conversation picks up from there. 
 I thought this was worth sharing because this community tends to judge liberal and leftwing narcissism quite harshly (as did Alone), and while those critiques are correct we should remember that narcissism is a civlizational affliction. What is narcissism filtered through the lens of traditional conservatism? While the word narcissism is never used, I think the hosts do a good job outlining the form it takes.

The author isn't writing on an academic site (possibly a quack), but does raise some good points about the limits of stealth aircraft and warships against peer opponents. Specifically, he mentioned the effectiveness of phased radar against stealth aircraft and ineffectiveness of radar-absorbing-materials against frequencies they weren't designed to absorb. 
 For those who have more understanding of stealth technology, is he actually right about cost effective countermeasures to stealth aircraft? Given that the US has invested heavily in stealth technology, while other powers are either far behind, or have a tertiary focus on stealth (Eurofighter) is he right to say that it's not cost-effective?

 They must seek out habitable earth-like planets essentially. Under the assumption they’re just as susceptible or similarly susceptible as humans to things like extreme heat and extreme gravity. 
 This presumably applies even to a space-faring species that has developed travel via means of bending space time. They would have to be confidently precise in where they’re going and the conditions of their destination. 
 This leads me to wonder if they’re something more strictly local, perhaps Milky Way based. I imagine “jumping ship” to another galaxy, even if theoretically possible for them, would be incredibly frightening and fraught with risk. 
 Perhaps they’re truly local explorers.

 As the government is unable to reach an accord with the owner, the real test for the future of Red House is whether the government and the conservationists can prevent the owner from forcibly demolishing the building using various means. 
 This is not the first time the building faces such danger - there were protests back in 1995 to preserve the place. Even though its connection with Sun Yat Sen is not confirmed, its cultural significance should see it being protected.

We’re out on the streets; we’re signing petitions; we’re sending letters to MPs; we’re taking direct action – the call from the people is resounding. So why are our governments sitting so stubbornly in their inaction?  
The answer is simple. Their refusal to vote or call for a ceasefire is reflective of their priority: to protect an ethno-fascist settler colony that furthers their own imperialist interests, rather than to represent the will of their constituents – and it is coming at the unforgivable cost of genocide.
